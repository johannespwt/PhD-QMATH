\chapter{The ground state energy of the one dimensional dilute Bose gas (paper)}\label{ChapterTheGroundStateEnergyOfTheOneDimensionalDiluteBoseGas}
This chapter contains a revised edition of the preprint \cite{agerskov2022ground}. To be transparent about this being a collaboration with my co-authors Robin Reuvers and Jan Philip Solovej and to emphasize that this work stands on its own, the title page with abstract and authors is included. Furthermore, the labeling of equations, theorems, lemma, and references is kept separate from the rest of the thesis.\\
Repetitions from the preceding chapters of this thesis might occur, and repetitions of the content in this preprint may also occur in the following chapters. When referring to the results of this preprint, we shall state ``from Chapter \ref{ChapterTheGroundStateEnergyOfTheOneDimensionalDiluteBoseGas}" explicitly and refer to the labeling in this chapter.
