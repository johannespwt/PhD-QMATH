\chapter{The ground state energy of the one dimensional dilute Bose gas (paper)}\label{ChapterTheGroundStateEnergyOfTheOneDimensionalDiluteBoseGas}
This chapter contains a revised edition of the preprint \cite{agerskov2022ground}. In order to be transparent about this being a collaboration with my co-authors Robin Reuvers and Jan Philip Solovej and to emphasize that this work stands on is own, the title page with abstract and authors is included. Furthermore, the labeling of equations, theorems, lemma, and references is kept seperate from the rest of the thesis.\\
Repetitions from the preceeding chapters of this thesis might occur, and repitions of the content in this preprint may also occur in the following chapters. When refering to results of this preprint, we shall state ```from Chapter \ref{ChapterTheGroundStateEnergyOfTheOneDimensionalDiluteBoseGas}" explicitly and refer to the labeling in this chapter.
