\chapter{The Ground State Energy of the One-dimensional Dilute Bose Gas (Preprint)}\label{ChapterTheGroundStateEnergyOfTheOneDimensionalDiluteBoseGas}
This chapter contains a revised edition of the preprint, \cite{agerskov2022ground}, written as part of a collaboration with Robin Reuvers and Jan Philip Solovej. To emphasize the independence of this preprint from the rest of thesis, the title page with abstract and authors is included. Furthermore, the labeling of equations, theorems, lemma, and references is kept separate from the rest of the thesis.\\
Repetitions from the preceding chapters of this thesis might occur, and repetitions of the content in this preprint may also occur in the following chapters. When referring to the results of this preprint, we shall state ``from Chapter \ref{ChapterTheGroundStateEnergyOfTheOneDimensionalDiluteBoseGas}" explicitly and refer to the labeling in this chapter.
