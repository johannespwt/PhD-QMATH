\maketitle
I think it was difficult to address an abstract topic for student who had no prerequisites and no preparation time. I think it is hard to know where to set the difficulty of the lecture and to make the material less abstract.\\
\\
One solution could be increased use of illustrations and figures, as well as handing out my slides/lecture notes before the lecture starts.\\
\\
In the future I will try to include more illustrations and figures to make the material less abstract, also I will make my slides and notes accessible to the students, such that they may use them personally.
