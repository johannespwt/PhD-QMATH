abstract = "We consider a quantum system in dimension three composed by a group of N identical fermions, with mass 1/2, interacting via zero-range interaction with a group of M identical fermions of a different type, with mass m/2. Exploiting a renormalization procedure, we construct the corresponding quadratic form and define the so-called Skornyakov-Ter-Martirosyan extension Hα, which is the natural candidate as a possible Hamiltonian of the system. It is shown that if the form is unbounded from below then Hα is not a self-adjoint and bounded from below operator, and this in particular suggests that the so-called Thomas effect could occur. In the special case N = 2, M = 1 we prove that this is in fact the case when a suitable condition on the parameter m is satisfied."
