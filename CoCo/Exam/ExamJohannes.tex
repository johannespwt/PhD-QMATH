	\section*{Question 1}
	Consider the following languages over the alphabet $\Sigma=\{a, b, c\}:$
	
	$$
	\begin{array}{l}
	L_{1}=\left\{w \in \Sigma^{*}: w\right.$ contains an odd number of occurrences of the letter $\left.a\right\}\\
	L_{2}=\left\{a^{m} b^{n} c^{m+n}: m, n \in \mathbb{N}\right\} \\
	L_{3}=\left\{a^{m} c^{m+n} b^{n}: m, n \in \mathbb{N}\right\} \\
	L_{4}=\left\{a^{m} c^{m^{2} n^{2}} b^{n}: m, n \in \mathbb{N}\right\}
	\end{array}
	$$
	\subsection*{Part 1.1}
	We show that $ L_1 $ is regular, and it thus follows that it also is context-free by Corollary 2.32 in M. Sipser.
	\begin{proof}
		The DFA in Figure \ref{fig:1} recognizes $ L_1 $, it then follows from definition 1.16 that $ L_1 $ is regular.
		\begin{figure}[h!]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=12cm]{dfa1.jpg}
			\caption{DFA that reckognizes $ L_1$}
			\label{fig:1}
		\end{figure}
	\end{proof}
	
	\subsection*{Part 1.2}
	We show that $ L_2 $ is not regular, but it is context-free.
	\begin{proof}
		That is $ L_2 $ is not regular can be seen by the following proof by contradiction: Assume $ L_2 $ is regular, and let $ p $ denote the pumping length as given by the pumping lemma for regular languages Theorem 1.70. Consider now the string $ w=a^pb^pc^{2p}\in L_2 $, which clearly satisfies $ \abs{w}>p $. Thus by the pumping lemma we can split $ w=xyz $ with $ \abs{xy}\leq p $ and $ \abs{y}>0 $. Clearly we then have $ xy=a^k $ for some $ 0<k\leq p $, and therefore $ y=a^m $ for some $ 0<m\leq p $. But then clearly $ xy^iz=a^{p+(i-1)m}b^pc^{2p} $ which for $ i\neq 1 $ is not in $ L_2 $, contradicting the pumping lemma. Thus we conclude that $ L_2 $ is not regular. \\
		That $ L_2 $ is context-free can be seen by the fact that it is generated by the CFG\begin{equation*}
			\begin{aligned}
			S&\to aAc,\\
			A&\to aAc\pipe bBc,\\
			B&\to bBc\pipe\epsilon.
			\end{aligned}
		\end{equation*}
		Notice that it is not clear wether $ \N $ contains $ 0 $ or not. Since the concention in M. Sipser is $ \N=\{1,2,3,....\} $ that is what is used here. But even if $ \N=\{0,1,2,...\} $ $ L_2 $ is still context-free since then if is generated by CFG
		\begin{equation*}
		\begin{aligned}
		S&\to aAc\pipe\epsilon,\\
		A&\to aAc\pipe B,\\
		B&\to bBc\pipe\epsilon.
		\end{aligned}
		\end{equation*}
	\end{proof}
	
	\subsection*{Part 1.3}
	We show that $ L_3 $ is not regular, but it is context-free.
	\begin{proof}
		The proof essentially goes as that for $ L_2 $. \\
		That is $ L_3 $ is not regular can be seen by the following proof by contradiction: Assume $ L_3 $ is regular, and let $ p $ denote the pumping length as given by the pumping lemma for regular languages Theorem 1.70. Consider now the string $ w=a^pb^{2p}c^{p}\in L_3 $, which clearly satisfies $ \abs{w}>p $. Thus by the pumping lemma we can split $ w=xyz $ with $ \abs{xy}\leq p $ and $ \abs{y}>0 $. Clearly we then have $ xy=a^k $ for some $ 0<k\leq p $, and therefore $ y=a^m $ for some $ 0<m\leq p $. But then clearly $ xy^iz=a^{p+(i-1)m}b^{2p}c^{p} $ which for $ i\neq 1 $ is not in $ L_3 $, contradicting the pumping lemma. Thus we conclude that $ L_3 $ is not regular. \\
		That $ L_3 $ is context-free can be seen by the fact that it is generated by the CFG
		\begin{equation*}
		\begin{aligned}
		S&\to aAc^2Cc,\\
		A&\to aAc\pipe \epsilon,\\
		C&\to cCb\pipe\epsilon.
		\end{aligned}
		\end{equation*}
		if $ \N=\{1,2,3,...\} $ and by CFG
		\begin{equation*}
		\begin{aligned}
		S&\to AC,\\
		A&\to aAc\pipe \epsilon,\\
		C&\to cCb\pipe\epsilon.
		\end{aligned}
		\end{equation*}
		if $ \N=\{0,1,2,3,...\} $
	\end{proof}
	\subsection*{Part 1.4}
	We show that $ L_4 $ is not context-free, and it then clearly follows from Corollary 2.32 that $ L_4 $ is not regular.
	\begin{proof}
		Assume that $ L_4 $ is context-free, and let $ p $ be the pumping length as given by the pumping lemma for context-free languages Theorem 2.34. Consider then the string $ w=a^pc^{p^2+1}b $. By the pumping lemma we may split $ w=uvxyz $ where $ \abs{vy}>0 $ and $ \abs{vxy}\leq p $. Thus either $ vxy=a^k $ for some $ 0<k\leq p $ in which case $ vy=a^m $ for some $ 0<m\leq p $, but then $ uv^ixy^iz=a^{p+(i-1)m}c^{p^2+1}b $ which is not in $ L_4 $ for $ i\neq 1 $, contradicting the pumping lemma. Or $ vxy=a^kc^l $ for some $ 0<k+l\leq p $, but then $ vy=a^sc^t $ for some $  0<k+l\leq p  $ and $ uv^ixy^iz=a^{p+(i-1)s}c^{p^2+1+(i-1)t}b  $, but clearly there exist for any $ s,t $ such that $ s>0 $ an $ i\in\{0,1,2,...\} $ such that $ (p+(i-1)s)^2>p^2+1+(i-1)t $, and thus for such an $ i $, $ uv^ixy^iz $ is not in $ L_4 $ contradicting the pumping lemma and if $ s=0 $ we obviously have $ uv^ixy^iz=a^{p+(i-1)s}c^{p^2+1+(i-1)t}b \notin L_4 $ also contradicting the pumping lemma. Or we may have $ vxy=c^k $ for some $ 0<k\leq p $, in which case $ vy=c^m $ for some $ 0<m\leq p $, but then $ uv^ixy^iz=a^pc^{p^2+1+(i-1)m}b $ which is not in $ L_4 $ for $ i\neq 1 $ contradicting the pumping lemma. Finally we may have $ vxy=c^kb $ in which case the contradicting is obtained by the same method as for $ vxy=a^kc^l $. Thus a contradiction is unavoidable, and we conclude that $ L_4 $ is not context-free.
	\end{proof}
	
	\subsection*{Part 1.5}
	We show now that $ L_4 $ belongs to L.
	\begin{proof}
	We assume that $ \N=\{1,2,3,...\} $, but the proof works for $ \N=\{0,1,2,...\} $ with small modifications. Consider the log-space TM, $ M= $"On input $ w $\begin{enumerate}
			\item Scan the input, and compare neighboring letters (by storing and overwriting one letter on the worktape all the way). If ever substring $ ab $, $ ca $, $ ba $ or $ bc $ is found, \emph{reject}.
			\item Count the number of $ a $s, $ b $s and $ c $s with three counters, $ i,j,k $ respectively, on the worktape. 
			\item Check that $ i^2+j^2=k $. If yes $ \emph{accept} $, if no, \emph{reject}."	
			\end{enumerate}
			Evidently this $ M $ decides $ L_4 $. Furthermore, it is log-space, as the first step requires only one slot on the worktape, step $ 2 $ requires only tree counters (in binary) which take up only logarithmic space. And finally we may multiply $ i\cdot i $ by adding $ i $, $ i $ times, which can be done by having an extra counter keeping track of how many times we have added $ i $. Of course we also need the obviuous seperator symbols, which can clearly be included in log space. Thus we see that $ M $ run in logarithmic space, and we conclude that $ L_4 $ is in L.
	\end{proof}
	\section*{Question 2}
	For any string $ w $ we let $ rev(w) $ denote the reverse of $ w $.
	\subsection*{Part 2.1}
	We consider in the following the language 
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{aligned}
		\mathrm{REV}_{\mathrm{TM}}=\{\langle M, w\rangle \mid M\text{ is a TM such that at some point during the execution of $M$ on $w$}\\
		\text{the tape of $M$ consists of $rev(w)$ followed by only blank symbols }\}
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation*}
	\subsection*{Part 2.2}
	We show that $ \text{REV}_{\text{TM}} $ is Turing recognizable.
	\begin{proof}
		The following TM, recognizes $ \text{REV}_{\text{TM}} $, $ M'= $"On input $ \braket{M,w} $\begin{enumerate}
			\item Simulate $ M $ on $ w $ 
			\item While $ M $ is running: 
			\item\qquad keep a counter, $ i $, of how many computation steps of $ M $ have been simulated.
			
			\item \begin{addmargin}[2em]{0em}In each computation step of $ M $, compare the first $ \min(i,\abs{w}) $ entries of the tape to $ rev(w) $, if at some point the tape content mathces $ rev(w) $ \emph{accept}. If $ M $ halts without $ rev(w) $ appearing on the tape, \emph{reject}.
				\end{addmargin}
		\end{enumerate}
		Clearly $ M' $ accept if and only if there is some point where the tape content of $ M $ running on $ w $ mathces $ rev(w) $. Notice that the counter $ i $ ensures that the checking in each step can be done in finite time, and also that the tape content of $ M $ clearly cannot be anything but blank beyond $ i $, since $ M $ have not have time to alter these tape cells yet.
	\end{proof} 
	\subsection*{Part 2.3}
	We show that $ \text{REV}_{\text{TM}} $ is not decidable.
	\begin{proof}
		This follows by simply noting that we can reduce $ A_{TM} $ to $ \text{REV}_{TM} $ by the following reduction: For any $ \braket{M,w} $ construct $ \braket{\tilde{M},w} $, where $ \tilde{M} $ is equivalent to $ M $ but it starts by writing a special character, which is not in the input alphabet, on the tape, say $\aleph $, which does not interfere with the computation, and it erases the tape (including $ \aleph $) and writes $ rev(w) $ on the tape before accepting. Then clearly $ \braket{\tilde{M},w}\in \text{REV}_{\text{TM}} $ if and only if $ \braket{M,w}\in A_{TM} $. Furthermore, this reduction is clearly done by a computatble function. Thus we conclude that $ A_{TM}\leq \text{REV}_{\text{TM}} $ and it follows by Theorem 4.11 and Corollary 5.23 that $ \text{REV}_{\text{TM}} $ is undecidable.
	\end{proof}
	
	\subsection*{Part 2.4}
	Let $f: \Sigma^{*} \rightarrow \Sigma^{*}$ be a computable function. We show that there is a TM $M$ with the property that $f(\langle M\rangle)$ is a description of a TM $M^{\prime}$ such that for each $w \in \Sigma^{*}$,
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $M$ halts on $w$ if and only if $M^{\prime}$ halts on $w$, and
		\item if $M^{\prime}$ halts on $w$ with a string $s_{w}$ on its tape then $M$ halts on $w$ with the string $s_{w} s_{w}$ on its tape.
	\end{enumerate}
\begin{proof}
	Consider the following TM, $ M= $"On input $ w $\begin{enumerate}
		\item Obtain own describtion via recursion theorem (Thm 6.3).
		\item Compute $ f(M) $, and let $ G $ be the TM such that $ \braket{G}=f(M) $.
		\item Simulate $ G $ on $ w $. If $ G $ halts, erase everything on the tape exept the tape content of $ G $ and duplicate the tape content. \emph{Accept} if $ G $ accepted and \emph{reject} if $ G $ rejected."
	\end{enumerate}
	Clearly, if $ f(M) $ is a describtion of the TM $ M' $ we see that $ M $ halts if and only if $ M' $ halts, since $ M $ simulates $ M' $ in its describtion. Also we see that by design, $ M $ will have exactly $ s_ws_w $ on the tape when halting on $ w $, if $ M' $ have $ s_w $ on the tape when halting on $ w $. Thus $ M $ is exactly a describtion of the desired TM.
\end{proof}
	\section*{Question 3}
	For a directed graph $G=(V, E)$ and a subset $V^{\prime}$ of $V$, the induced subgraph $G\left[V^{\prime}\right]$ is the subgraph of $G$ with vertex set $V^{\prime}$ and edge set consisting of those edges of $E$ with both endpoints in $V^{\prime}$.
	
	When we refer to a cycle in the following, we refer to a directed graph consisting of distinct vertices $v_{1}, v_{2}, \ldots, v_{m}$ and edges $\left(v_{i}, v_{i+1}\right)$ for $i=1,2, \ldots, m-1$, and an edge $\left(v_{m}, v_{1}\right) ; m$ is the size of the cycle. Let $s \geq 2$ be a given integer and consider the following decision problem:
	
	Let $s \geq 2$ be a given integer and consider the following decision problem:
	\begin{equation*}
		s-C Y C L E=\{\langle G\rangle \mid G=(V, E)\text{ is a directed graph with a cycle of size $s$ as subgraph}\}
	\end{equation*}
	\subsection*{Part 3.1}
	We show that $ s-CYCLE $ belongs to P.
	\begin{proof}
		Consider the following TM $ M= $"On input $ \braket{G} $\begin{enumerate}
			\item For each collection of $ s $ vertices in $ G $, $ v_1,...,v_s $:
			\item \begin{addmargin}[2em]{0em} Check that there are edges in $ G $: $(v_i,v_{i+1}) $ for $ i=1,...,m-1 $ and an edge $ (v_s,v_1) $. If yes, \emph{accept}.
			\end{addmargin}
			\item \emph{reject.}"
		\end{enumerate}
		Clearly, the loop in step one have at most $ n^s $ iterations, where $ n $ is the number of vertices in $ G $, as there are less than $ n^s $ ways of choosing $ s $ vertices out of $ n $. And it is clear that step $ 2 $ is polynomial in time as there are at most $ n^2 $ edges in $ G $. Thus, $M $ runs in polynomial time. It is also clear by design, that $ M $ accepts $ \braket{G} $ if and only if, $ G $ has a cycle of size $ s $ as a subgraph. Therefore $ s-CYCLE $ is in P.
		
%		The problem is similar to $ PATH $ and we construct a polynomial time TM, that resembles the one from the proof that $ PATH $ is in P.\\
%		Consider the TM $ M= $"In input $ \braket{G} $\begin{enumerate}
%			\item For each node, $ v $, in $ G $: 
%			\item \qquad Place a mark on $ v $ and set $ i:=0 $.
%			\item \qquad Repeat until no more vertices are marked or $ i=s $:
%			\item \begin{addmargin}[4em]{0em} If $ i<s $: Scan all edges of $ G $, if there is an edge from a marked vertex to an unmarked vertex, mark the unmarked one.
%			\end{addmargin}
%			\item\begin{addmargin}[4em]{0em}
%				If $ i=s $: Scan all edges of $ G $, if there is an edge from a marked vertex to an unmarked vertex, mark the unmarked one with a special mark, \eg a $ * $.
%			\end{addmargin}
%			\item\begin{addmargin}[4em]{0em}
%				$ i:=i+1 $
%			\end{addmargin}
%			\item\qquad If $ v $ is marked by $ \ast $, \emph{accept}.
%			\item \emph{reject.}
%		\end{enumerate}
%		Notice that the all steps $ 2-6 $ are repeated $ n $ times, where $ n $ is number of vertices. Step $ 2 $ is trivially polynomial in time. Step $ 4- 6 $ are repeated at most $ s $ times, and each of them are clearly polynomial in time. 
%		Thus collecting all the above, we see that the runtime of $ M $ is clearly at most polynomial in the number of vertices, and therefore in the input length. It is also clear by design that $ M $ accepts $ \braket{G} $ is and only if 
	\end{proof}
	
	\subsection*{Part 3.2}
	For $ s\geq2 $ consider now
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{aligned}
		s-C Y C L E-H I T T I N G-S E T=\{\langle G, k\rangle \mid G=(V, E)\text{ is a directed graph, $k \in \mathbb{N}$,}\\ \text{and there is
		a subset $V^{\prime} \subseteq V$ of size $k$ such that $G\left[V \backslash V^{\prime}\right]$}\\ \text{
		contains no cycle of size $s$ as subgraph }\}
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation*}
	We show that $ s-C Y C L E-H I T T I N G-S E T $ is in NP.
	\begin{proof}
		We construct a polynomial time verifier, $ V $, that verifies $ s-C Y C L E-H I T T I N G-S E T $. $ V $ takes as a certificate a subset $ V' $ of vertices of $ G $. $ V= $"On input $ (\braket{G,k},c) $\begin{enumerate}
			\item Check that $ \abs{c}=k $, if not \emph{reject}.
			\item Construct $ G'=G[V\setminus V'] $.
			\item Run $ M $, from Part 3.1, on $ \braket{G'} $, if $ M $ accepts, \emph{reject}, if  $ M $ rejects, \emph{accept}.
		\end{enumerate}
		Clearly $ V $ runs in polynomial time, as each step if polynomial in time (step 3 because of the result in 3.1). Furthermore, if $ \braket{G,k} $ is in $ s-C Y C L E-H I T T I N G-S E T $ there exist a $ c $ such that $ V $ accepts $ (\braket{G,k},c) $, and if $ \braket{G,k} $ is not in $ s-C Y C L E-H I T T I N G-S E T $ such a $ c $ can clearly not exist. Thus we conclude that $ V$ is a polynomial time verifier for $ s-C Y C L E-H I T T I N G-S E T $ and therefore it belongs to NP.
	\end{proof}
	
	\subsection*{Part 3.3}
	We show that $ s-C Y C L E-H I T T I N G-S E T $ is NP-complete for every $ s\geq 2 $.
	\begin{proof}
		By the result of Part 3.2 we need only show that $ s-C Y C L E-H I T T I N G-S E T $ is NP-hard. This is done by polynomial time reducing from $ VERTEX\tm COVER $ which is NP-complete by Theorem 7.44, it then follows from Theorem 7.36 that $ s-C Y C L E-H I T T I N G-S E T $ is NP-hard (actually the theorem states that then $ s-C Y C L E-H I T T I N G-S E T $ is NP-complete, since it is NP).\\
		Consider the following reduction: Given $ \braket{G,k} $ where $ G $ is an undirected graph, construct $ \braket{G',k} $ where $ G' $ is the directed graph with all edges in $ G $, $ (u,v) $ replaced by a (directed) cycle of size $ s $ $ (v_1,v_2),...,(v_m,u),\ (u,v_m+1),...,(v_{s-2},v) $. Clearly if $ \braket{G,k} $ is in $ VERTEX\tm COVER $, then there is a $ k $-node vertex cover of $ G $ and that exact vertex-cover is a subset of vertices $ V' $ of $ G' $ such that $ G'[V\setminus V'] $ does not contain a cycle of size $ s $, since such a cycle had to come from an edge of $ G $ but all edges touched at least one vertex in $ V' $. Thus, if $ \braket{G,k}\in VERTEX\tm COVER $ we have $ \braket{G',k} $ is in $ s-C Y C L E-H I T T I N G-S E T  $. On the other hand if $ \braket{G,k} $ is not in $ VERTEX\tm COVER $, then for any subset of vertices, $ V' $ of $ G $ of size $ k $, there is an edge $ (u,v) $ such that $ u,v\notin V' $. \\
		On the contrary if $ \braket{G',k} $ is in $ s-C Y C L E-H I T T I N G-S E T $, then there is a subset of vertices $ V' $ of $ G' $ of size $ k $ such that $ G'[V\setminus V'] $ contains no cycle of size $ s $ as a subgraph. But then $ V' $ must contain a vertex in each of the constructed cycles between the vertices of $ G $ or equivalently for each vertex $ v' $ in $ V' $, $ v' $ sits in a cycle of length $ s $ between two vertices of $ G $ (by construction) and there is a vertex $ v $ in $ G $ such that $ v $ is the first vertex of $ G $ , which is reached by following that cycle. Let then $ \tilde{V} $ be the set consisting of vertices of $ G $, that are reached first from the vertices of $ V' $ by following their corresponding cycles. Clearly because $ v\in \tilde{V} $ sits in the same cycles as $ v'\in V' $, we see that $ G'[V\setminus\tilde{V}] $ has no cycle of size $ s $ as a subgraph. But then any edge in $ G $ must touch a vertex in $ \tilde{V} $. Since if an edge $ (u,v) $ did not touch any $ v\in\tilde{V} $, the corresponding cycle comming from that edge in the construction above would be a cycle of size $ s $ in $ G'[V\setminus \tilde{V}] $.\\
		Therefore we conclude that $ \braket{G,k} $ is in $ VERTEX\tm COVER $ if and only if $ \braket{G',k} $ is in $ s-C Y C L E-H I T T I N G-S E T $. 
		We also note that the construction $ \braket{G,k}\mapsto \braket{G',k} $ clearly is computable in polynomial time, as we need only include $ s-2 $ extra vertices, remove one edge, and add $ s $ extra edges, for each edge in $ G $. Therefore we conclude that \begin{equation*}
			VERTEX\tm COVER\leq_P s-C Y C L E-H I T T I N G-S E T
		\end{equation*}
		and it follows from Theorem 7.36 that $ s-C Y C L E-H I T T I N G-S E T $ is NP-complete.
	\end{proof}
	
	\section*{Question 4}
		Recall that a string $x$ is a substring of a string $y$ if there are (possibly empty) strings $w, r$ such that $y=w x r$. For example, every string is a substring of itself, and the string $b a$ is a substring of $a b b a$, but the string $a a$ is not a substring of $a b b a$. Consider the following two sets:
		\begin{equation*}
			\begin{aligned}
			\mathrm{NFA-NO-GO}=\{(a, A): a\text{ is a letter, and
			$A$ is an NFA such that no string accepted by $A$}\\
		\text{contains $a$ as a substring }\}
			\end{aligned}
		\end{equation*}
		\begin{equation*}
			\begin{aligned}
			\mathrm{NFA-NO-GO-NFA} =\{(B, A): B\text{ and $A$ are NFAs over the same alphabet such that no}\\\text{
			string accepted by $A$ contains any string accepted by $B$
			as a substring }\}
			\end{aligned}
		\end{equation*}
	\subsection*{Part 4.1}
	We show that $ \mathrm{NFA-NO-GO} $ is NL-complete.
	\begin{proof}
		First we show that $ \mathrm{NFA-NO-GO} $ is in NL. We do this by showing that $ \mathrm{NFA-NO-GO} $ is in coNL, and it then follows by Theorem 8.27 (NL$ = $coNL) that $ \mathrm{NFA-NO-GO} $ is in NL. Notice first that if an NFA $ A $ accept a string with the letter $ a $ in it, then it accepts a string of lenght at most $ 2p $ with the letter $ a $ in it, where $ p $ is number of states of the NFA. This can be seen by the pigeon hole principle. Assume that $ A $ accepts $ w $, $ a $ is a substring of $ w $, and $ \abs{w}>2p $, then clearly $ A $ must loop at least twice on $ w $. Therefore the substring $ a $ is read while $ A $ is in one of loops, or before or after the loops. In any case, we may remove all parts of the string $ w $ that does not contain $ a $ and that makes $ A $ loop. After this removal we are left with a string $ w' $ that contains $ a $ and which makes $ A $ loop at most once, thus it has lenght $ \abs{w'}\leq 2p $.  Now consider the following logarithmic space NTM $ M= $"On input $ (a,A) $\begin{enumerate}
			\item Check that $ a $ is a letter, if not \emph{accept}.
			\item Check that $ A $ is an NFA, if not \emph{accept}.
			\item Set $ p:= $the number of states of $ A $.
			\item Set $i:=1  $ and $ j=0 $.
			\item While $ i\leq 2p $
			\item \begin{addmargin}[2em]{0em} Non-determinitically store a letter, $ b $, on the worktape (overwrite if one is already stored).
			\end{addmargin} 
			\item \qquad If $ b=a $, set $ j:=1 $.
			\item \qquad Simulate $ A $ on $ b $ and store its current state, if it accepts and $ j=1 $, $ \emph{accept} $. 
			\item \qquad If $ i=2p $ and $ A $ does not accept, \emph{reject}.
			\item \qquad $ i:=i+1 $
		\end{enumerate} 
		Evidently, by the above discussion, $ M $ accepts the language \begin{equation*}
			\begin{aligned}
			\overline{\mathrm{NFA-NO-GO}}=\{(a,A)\pipe a\text{ is not a letter, or }A \text{ is not an NFA, or }A\text{ accept a string with }a\\
			\text{ as a substring.}   \}
			\end{aligned}
		\end{equation*}
		Furthermore, $ M $ clearly runs in at most logarithmic space since it stores only counters of size up to $ 2p $ where $ p $ is number of states of $ A $, and simulates an NFA, which requires no space. Thus we conclude that $ \overline{\mathrm{NFA-NO-GO}}\in \text{NL} $, or equivalently that $ \mathrm{NFA-NO-GO}\in\text{coNL}=\text{NL} $.
